/*

/ VARIABLES
In any lanugage a variable is a name given to a memory location. 
It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
Variables are containers for storing data values.
The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.

NOTE: A variable name can consist of alphabets (both upper and lower case), numbers and the underscore ‘_’ character. 
NOTE: The name must not start with a number.

/*
/ DECLARING/CREATING VARIABLES IN CPP

.1) Declaring a single variable
type variable_name;

.2) Declaring multiple variables:
type variable1_name, variable2_name, variable3_name;

*/
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
. In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

*/

// . We can also assign value to the cariable along with its declaration or after that.

int hello;

int hello = 2;
