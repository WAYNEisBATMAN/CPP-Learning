/ CONTROL STRUCTURE
Control Structures are just a way to specify flow of control in programs. 

/ There are three basic types of Flow of control, Flow Logic, Flow Structure

.1) Sequential Flow (Sequence logic) 
Sequential logic as the name suggests follows a serial or sequential flow in which the flow depends on the series of instructions 
given to the computer.

-   Action 1
-      |
-      |
-   Action 2
-      |
-      |
-   Action 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.2) Conditional Flow (Selection logic) (Conditional Structure)
Selection Logic simply involves choosing between 2 or more alternative paths.
On the basis of alternative paths it is mainly of three types.

-(a) Single Alternative 
If (condition) then:
     ...


-(b) Double Alternative 
If (Condition), then:
     ...

Else:
     ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-(c) Multiple Alternative
If (condition A), then:
     ...
     ...

Else if (condition B), then:
     ...
     ...
     
Else if (condition N), then:
     ...
     ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.3) Repetitive Flow (Iteration logic) (Iterative Structure/Loops)
The Iteration logic employs a loop which involves a repeat statement followed by some statements known as the body of a loop.

There are mainly 3 types of Iterative structures/Loops

-(a) For                (b) While               (c) do while
