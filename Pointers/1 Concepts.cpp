/*
/ Pointers in C++
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming.
There are following few important pointer concepts which should be clear to a C++ programmer âˆ’

.1) Null Pointers
C++ supports null pointer, which is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.

.2) Pointer Arithmetic
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, -

.3) Pointers vs Arrays
There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays.

.4) Array of Pointers
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.

.5) Pointer to Pointer
C++ allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.

.6) Passing Pointers to Functions
Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.

.7) Return Pointer from Functions
C++ allows a function to return a pointer to local variable, static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well.
