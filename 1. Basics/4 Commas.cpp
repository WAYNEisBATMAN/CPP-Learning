/*
/ USE OF SINGLE AND DOUBLE QUOTES 

. In C AND C++ single quotes are used for a single character and double quotes are used for  string literals
 a string literal "x" contains a character 'x' and a null character terminator '\0'
 So "x" is a two character array in this case


- So if we compare a single string character and a single string literal 
"x"
char hello1 = 'x';
char hello2 = "x";

: Here hello1 is a single character and the hello2 is a single-letter string literal
: Which makes the single letter string literals takes the double the space of single character.
