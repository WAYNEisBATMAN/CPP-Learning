/*
/ 1. Declaration: 
Declaration means creating a variable by telling the compiler about name of the variable, type of value it holds.
E.g.  int a; 

This comes under variable declaration. 
We can say that we are creating a new variable (declaring in programming terms) so that it can be used in further parts of 
the program.

/ 2. Defintion:
Definition of a variable says where the variable gets stored. i.e., memory for the variable is allocated during the 
definition of the variable.
but in case of simple variables definition and declaration are both similar.


/ 3. Assignment: 
After declaration if we need to put some value in that, we write it like a = 10;.
Assignment can be done n number of times throughout the program. 
So here in the beginning, 'a' was holding some garbage value but now it has changed to 10.

/ 4. Initialization: 
Initialization is declaring a variable and assigning a value at the declaration time called initializing a variable.

E.g. int a=10;.

.  Initialization = Declaration + Assignment in a single step.
